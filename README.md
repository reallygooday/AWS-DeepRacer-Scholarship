Nanodegree scholarships will be provided to students with the best racing scores in the August, September, and October AWS DeepRacer races, as well as to students who record the highest total point scores across all 3 months.

AWS DeepRacer is 1/18th scale racing car built on reinforcement learning.

The Basic of reinforcement learning includes agents actions, enviroments, states and rewards.


- Agent - the entity exhibiting certain behaviors (actions) based on its environment. In our case, it’s our AWS DeepRacer car.
- Actions - what the agent chooses to do at certain places in the environment, such as turning, going straight, going backward, etc. Actions can be discrete or continuous.
- States - has to do with where in the environment the agent resides (at a specific location) or with what is going on in the environment (for a robotic vacuum, perhaps that its current location is also clean). By taking actions, the agent moves from one state to a new state. States can be partial or absolute. Absolute vs. partial states are different based on whether the agent can see the whole environment.

As reinforcement learning models interact with an environment, actions are rewarded or punished based on consequences from previous iterations.

In reinforcement learning, there’s an agent that takes an action based on its environment. Actions cause the environment to change to a new state, which may or may not yield points for the model.

AWS DeepRacer models learn which actions are ideal to take in the environment given a particular state, which yields rewards.

Machine Learning Algorithms:

- Supervised learning trains a model based on providing labels to each input, such as classifying between images of a bulldog and those that are not a bulldog.
- Unsupervised learning can use techniques like clustering to find relationships between different points of data, such as in detecting new types of fraud
- Reinforcement learning uses feedback from previous iterations, using trial and error, to improve performance.
